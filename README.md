## Retro:

**A question within the context of today’s lab assignment.**
How do we get dynamic maps, like Google Maps?

**An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.**
My 'Ah-hah!' was realizing I could write whatever I wanted into the error message in the try/catch.

**How long you spent working on this assignment**
I spent about 5 hours working on lab 06.
